This project involved importing, cleaning, and processing data for analysis and visualization in Power BI. The data was transformed to ensure quality and meaningful insights were derived. A dynamic and interactive dashboard was designed, featuring advanced charts, maps, filters, and slicers for enhanced data exploration. Forecasting models were applied to predict trends and future outcomes based on historical data. The final dashboard was exported as a PDF for easy sharing and reporting. Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data processing, advanced visualization techniques, and creating interactive dashboards in Power BI.
